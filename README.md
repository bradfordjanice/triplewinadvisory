# triplewinadvisory

This repository contains four animations:

- TYPICAL VALUE CHAIN MODEL
- CIRCULAR VALUE CHAIN MODEL
- EFFICIENCY MEASURES
- INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY MEASURES

Each animation is developed with SVG, CSS, HTML, and Javascript. No animation or Javascript libraries were used.

Each animation is embedded in an html file. The required CSS and Javascript files are linked. The navigation buttons are HTML, and have the required styling; they are not part of the SVG animation so they can easily be incorporated into the design of the Triple Win Advisory Wordpress website.

The struction of the directory is simple and easily changed to meet the requirements of the Triple Win Advisory Wordpress website.

The animations have been tested and are compatible with the Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers.
